# Ableitungsrechner/Derivative Calculator/VDex

A derivative calculator with the aim to show a step by step solution of how to get the derivative of a function. (The step by step solution is still work in progress)

This is a solo project of mine therefore I am the one designing, writing and coding this project and because I am neither a graphic designer nor a software engineer, don't be too harsh on me.

## Long Term Goals
* A fast and friendly to use derivative calculator 
* The addition of a plotter and a synchronized UI
* A detailed documentation of the inner workings of the calculator (mostly via code comments)
* Impressing my old physics teacher and my shunning and presumptuous friend

## Short Term Goals
* Adding trigonomical functions and the use of non-integer exponents for clauses
* Improving GUI
* Adding Step-by-Step
